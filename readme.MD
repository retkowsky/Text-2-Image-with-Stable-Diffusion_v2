# Text 2 Image with Stable Diffusion v2

**Stable Diffusion 2 is a text-to-image** latent diffusion model built upon the work of Stable Diffusion 1. The project to train Stable Diffusion 2 was led by Robin Rombach and Katherine Crowson from Stability AI and LAION.

The Stable Diffusion 2.0 release includes **robust text-to-image models trained using a brand new text encoder (OpenCLIP)**, developed by LAION with support from Stability AI, which greatly improves the quality of the generated images compared to earlier V1 releases.

The text-to-image models in this release can generate images with **default resolutions of both 512x512 pixels and 768x768 pixels**.
These models are trained on an aesthetic subset of the LAION-5B dataset created by the DeepFloyd team at Stability AI, which is then further filtered to remove adult content using LAIONâ€™s NSFW filter.
